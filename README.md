# Drum Kit website

Description:-
Created a Drum-kit website which have seven drums on each drum has button whenever user click the drum or press any specific key which has written on drum-kit then unique drum sound will play and animation will show.

Tech Stack:-
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML has one h1 which has heading Drum Kit, seven buttons and footer made by me.

CSS:- I have used inset and postion relative for placing each button on specific drum and given height and width of each button and used opacity for making transparent.

JavaScript:- I have used document.querySelectorAll for selecting all 7 buttons by using loop and added document.addEventListener for mouse click and key press the butons and click the drum. I have used audio object and play method to play the sound and for animation used classList.add and remove pressed class.
